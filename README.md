Dimagi Utils [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dimagi/dimagi-utils.png)](https://travis-ci.org/dimagi/dimagi-utils)
============

Misc utility code. Caution! This _is_ shared between a few projects and cannot 
be changed arbitrarily.

Note that some utilities have soft requirements - in other words they are not
automatically pulled in by `pip install dimagi-utils` but are required
for various pieces of functionality.

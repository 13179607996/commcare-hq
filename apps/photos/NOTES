HACKS
=====
This app required some more or less kludgy changes, as follows:

1. rapidsms.ini defines media_root=file:///tmp - this confused Django which simply appends media_root to project root. 
I commented out media_root to fix this.

2. rapidsms/lib/rapidsms/webui/urls.py maps all apps/<name>/static dirs to static/<name> URLs, serving via django.views.static.serve. This breaks ImageField 'url' property. 
A special mapping in apps/photos/urls.py now handles that: 
	(r'^data/photos/(?P<path>.*)$',  'django.views.static.serve', {"document_root": 'data/photos/'}),
	
	
QUESTIONS
=========

1. Do we really need ImageKit? Why not just display the photos in the list view using IMG's width/height attributes?

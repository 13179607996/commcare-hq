    Make your ansible environment fab-ready
    =======================================

    Enter the commcarehq-ansible repo and make sure you have the latest

      cd ../commcarehq-ansible
      git pull

    enter the env

      workon ansible

    do the necessary pip installs

      pip install -r fab/requirements.txt

    and make sure the necessary files are in the right place

      ./control/check_install.sh

    Run a fab command!
    ==================

    Enter the fab directory of commcarehq-ansible

      cd commcarehq-ansible/fab

    Run your fab command

      fab production deploy


    Bonus: Run fab from any directory
    =================================

    You will always need to enter the ansible virtualenv to run fab from now on,
    but if you use the following alias, you can run it from anywhere.

      alias fab=fab -f ~/.commcare-cloud/fab/fabfile.py

    to add this to your .bash_profile you can run

      echo "alias fab=fab -f ~/.commcare-cloud/fab/fabfile.py" >> ~/.bash_profile

    Now from anywhere

      # workon ansible
      fab production deploy

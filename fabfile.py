    When you have done that, run

      fab

    Enter the commcarehq-ansible repo and make sure you have the latest

      cd ../commcarehq-ansible
      git pull

    enter the env

      workon ansible

    do the necessary pip installs

      pip install -r fab/requirements.txt

    and make sure the necessary files are in the right place

      ./control/check_install.sh

    Run a fab command!
    ==================

    Enter the fab directory of commcarehq-ansible

      cd commcarehq-ansible/fab

    Run your fab command

      fab production deploy


    Bonus: Run fab from any directory
    =================================

    You will always need to enter the ansible virtualenv to run fab from now on,
    but if you use the following alias, you can run it from anywhere.

      alias fab='fab -f ~/.commcare-cloud/repo/fab/fabfile.py'

    to make alias always available, add it to the profile file you use for your aliases,
    possibly one of the following:

      echo "alias fab='fab -f ~/.commcare-cloud/repo/fab/fabfile.py'" >> ~/.profile
      echo "alias fab='fab -f ~/.commcare-cloud/repo/fab/fabfile.py'" >> ~/.bash_profile
      echo "alias fab='fab -f ~/.commcare-cloud/repo/fab/fabfile.py'" >> ~/.bashrc

    Now from anywhere

      workon ansible
      fab production deploy

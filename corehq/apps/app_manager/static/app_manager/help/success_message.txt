<p>
    You can optionally specify a template for the message that your CHWs receive upon successful
    submission of a form.
</p>
<p>
    In the template, you have access to the following variables gathered real-time from the server:
    firstname, name, num_forms_this_week, num_forms_today. You can use these by surrounding them in curly braces ({}).
</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p>
    Thanks {firstname}! You have submitted {num_forms_today} forms today and {num_forms_this_week} forms since Monday.

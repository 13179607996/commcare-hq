Hello,
</p>

<p>
Upon reviewing our monthly invoices generated on Sunday, May 1, we uncovered that your project space was mistakenly received an invoice for costs that should have been covered from your existing plan credits or existing contract payments.
</p>

<p>
Please ignore the invoice sent on Sunday. We will be sending an updated invoice to the same addresses within 24 hours, which will show the correct invoice charges. No action is required on your end at this time.
</p>

<p>
We apologize for the inconvenience. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions.
</p>

<p>
Best, <br/>

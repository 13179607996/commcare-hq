Hello,
</p>

<p>
Upon reviewing our monthly invoices generated on the first of May, we uncovered that your project space mistakenly received an invoice on Sunday.
</p>

<p>
No further action is required from your end related to this invoice. You have NO amount owed this month, and your invoice has been marked as paid.
</p>

<p>
Please accept our apologies for the mistaken invoice, and feel free to reach out if you have any questions.
</p>

<p>
Best,<br/>

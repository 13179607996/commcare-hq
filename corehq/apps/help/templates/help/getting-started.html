    <h1>Getting Started With CommCare HQ</h1>

    <h2>What is CommCare HQ?</h2>
    <img id="phone" src="/static/help/img/Nokia_2700_classic.jpg" />
    <p>CommCare HQ works together with the open-source mobile client CommCare to help rural health organizations
    replace paperwork with electronic forms filled on J2ME-compatible phones. Organizations build on the
    Community Health Worker (CHW) model will find that mobile data entry will provide the following benefits:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>See forms online immediately as they are submitted</li>
        <li>Easily view your data in a number of layouts</li>
        <li>Download and manipulate in Excel</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This document will show you how to get started using CommCare HQ.</p>

    <h2>What you need</h2>
    <p>In order to begin using CommCare HQ, all you need is a computer with an internet connection
    and at least one J2ME-compatible cellphone connected to the network. The phones must have a minimum
    of:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 MB heap size</li>
        <li>512 KB jar size</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Phone models that we know to work well are listed below. If you have a different model
    that can successfully CommCare, please <a href="mailto:droberts+commcarephones@dimagi.com">let us know</a>
    so we can add them to this list.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Nokia 2690</li>
        <li>Nokia 2700</li>
        <li>Nokia 2710</li>
        <li>Nokia 2730</li>
    </ul>


    <p>That's it. When you have built your forms and packaged them as an application using CommCare HQ's
    application builder, CommCare HQ will send the application to your phone(s) via SMS text message.</p>

    <h2>Building an Application</h2>

    <p>CommCare HQ allows you to build a custom application that packages all your forms together.</p>
    <p>Forms are grouped into modules. Every application contains one or more modules which each contain forms.
    When you run the application on your phone you will see that after logging in you will see a screen that lists
    the modules in your application. Selecting one of these modules will take you to a list of forms, which you can
    select to fill out.</p>
    <p>To get started,
    enter the application builder by clicking on the
        <a href="{% url corehq.apps.app_manager.views.default domain %}" target="_blank">Applications</a>
    link here or at the top of the page, and then create a new application. When you do so, you will be asked to
    give your application a name. This should create a new application with an "Untitled Module" and an "Untitled Form".
    You may edit the name of an application, module, or form by clicking on it and then changing the value in the "Name"
    field.</p>
    <p>Clicking the "Createâ€¦" button will take you to the form designer. Here you can list the questions, and
    decide for each question what kind of answer to expect: single select, multi-select, date, and
    free-form text are the most common types of questions. Once you are done, click Menu &lt; Save to Server.</p>
    <p>Now click on the "Release Manager" tab, then click on the "Make New Build" button. This should add a
    line to the list of saved builds listed on this page. Now you are ready to receive the application on your phone.
    Click "Send to Phones", and under "Send to", type in the number of the phone to which you want it sent.</p>
    <p>Your phone should now receive a text message. Open this text message and navigate to the url inside. This should
    prompt you to download the applications. Click through the notifications, and eventually CommCare should launch.</p>
    <p>Log in as admin with the password 234; this is the default login. </p>

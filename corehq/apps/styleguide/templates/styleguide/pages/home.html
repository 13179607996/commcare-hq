    <h1>CommCare HQ Style Guide</h1>
    <p class="lead">
        This is a communication and reference tool. It can be used to help make decisions that have already been thoughtfully made.
        By taking similar, simiplifed base patterns, often called "atoms", we can build cohesive "molecules" and
        then more complex "organisms." This keeps code cleaner and lighter while also keeping things simpler for our users to understand.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
        Why all the biology-related terminology? It comes from the notion of <a href='http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/' target="_blank">atomic design</a>.
        Atomic design relates design to the hierarchies and building processes of the natural world.
        It uses five stages: atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and pages.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
        HQ doesn't follow this methodology, but the rough ideas can still make for a useful framework.
        As such, this style guide is organized into atoms, molecules, and organisms.
    </p>

    <h2>Atoms</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Accessibility: what is it and why does it matter?</li>
        <li>Typography: what fonts do we use and why?</li>
        <li>Colors: why use one color or another?</li>
        <li>Icons: how do you find an icon that enhances your content?</li>
        <li>Code Guidelines: how does one write good CSS/LESS?</li>
    </ul>

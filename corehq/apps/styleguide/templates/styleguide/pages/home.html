        This is a communication and reference tool. It can be used to help make decisions that
        have already been thoughtfully made. Want to add new navigation? Perhaps you need to show a parent/child
        relationship, or show all the children, or their children. By taking similar, simiplifed base patterns,
        often called "Atoms", we can build cohesive molecules. This keeps code cleaner and lighter while also keeping
        things simpler for our users to understand.

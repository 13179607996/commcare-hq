# Third-Party Libraries

- jQuery: available throughout HQ
- Knockout: available throughout HQ. Should be on Knockout 3.0, although there are somea few places that haven't yet been upgraded from 2.x.
- Backbone: Used in CloudCare. Prefer Knockout for new code.
- Angular: Used in a few places (dashboards, exports, app summaries). Prefer Knockout for new code.
